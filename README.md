# University Projects - Sebastian Morgado

In this folder, there are all the projects that I have done throughout my career as a computer engineer, these are ordered by the year of each career. If you want to use the codes or parts of it, you are free to use them if you want. it is not necessary to mention me.

have you found a problem? or want to send a suggestion? feel free to send a pull request or notify me in the issues :) 

PS: I'm sorry to warn you that the codes are written in Spanish... if this doesn't bother you, you can keep watching them :)
