# Mathematica Pointer

Thanks for download my Pointer for mathematica.

first: what it this?, how the name says, it works like a laser pointer, but the main idea is that you can use your phone for it.

second: how can i use it?, well, you need compile it first (compile the .aia at http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/ (mit app inventor)), next you need install autoit v3 (https://www.autoitscript.com/cgi-bin/getfile.pl?autoit3/autoit-v3-setup.exe), install it and execute the .au3 file.

if you need help with it, or you find some bug, please report it at issues :D
